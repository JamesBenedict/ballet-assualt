<article>
<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ast March, a ballet student at IU’s Jacobs School of Music reported that a lecturer had sexually assaulted her while preparing for the previous fall’s “the Nutcracker.” She said he trapped her in his office, climbed on top of her, pulled off her leotard and tights and stopped only when he heard someone in the hall.

	<p>IU immediately placed the accused, Guoping Wang, on leave and assigned officials from the affirmative action and the dean of students offices to investigate. The internal investigation unearthed additional reports from six other students and staff of forced kissing on the mouth by Wang.</p>


	<p>The University did not report the alleged sexual assault &mdash; or the other allegations of unwanted advances &mdash; to the campus police department until May 4, six weeks after the ballet student reported it. </p>

	<p>IU announced Wang&rsquo;s termination the following Monday. In July, IU police officers arrested Wang and a prosecutor charged him with criminal confinement and sexual battery. He is currently out on bond, awaiting a pretrial hearing.</p>

	
	<p>University officials insist that all of IU&rsquo;s policies were followed in pursuing this investigation.</p>


	<p>&ldquo;I feel extremely confident that IU acted responsibly, ethically, professionally, and quickly in this case,&rdquo; Provost Lauren Robel said in an email to the Indiana Daily Student.</p>

	<p>Critics say the University should have called the police right away instead of asking administrators to investigate first. Wang&rsquo;s defense attorneys argue that delaying giving the case to professional law enforcement was unfair to both the ballet student and to their client.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like people who are not trained like detectives and police officers conducting investigations,&rdquo; Amelia Lahn, one of Wang&rsquo;s attorneys, said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t do it to the same standard, and then it&rsquo;s muddying the waters.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>The University&rsquo;s handling of the case raises a number of questions. Why did officials wait so long to notify IUPD? When did the Jacobs School of Music administrators first learn about any of the allegations made by the ballet student or the other students and staff?</p>

	<p>The timing of the University&rsquo;s disclosures raises more questions. IU announced Wang&rsquo;s firing and the alleged sexual assault they day after graduation, when most students had already left campus. Was that a coincidence, or was the University trying to protect the reputation of one of its most prestigious programs?</p>

	<p>Certainly, the music school was eager to limit public attention on the case. On May 9, the day of Wang's arrest, the music school&rsquo;s dean issued an email to students discouraging them from talking to the media.</p>

	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he answers to many of these questions are likely in a 13-page memorandum summarizing the findings and recommendations of the internal investigation. It also contains accounts by six other students and staff members. Over the past two and a half months, the IDS has repeatedly filed public records requests for the memo and any other documents related to this case.</p>

	<p>IU&rsquo;s lawyers have denied all of the requests, insisting the memo does not qualify as a public record for several reasons, including the fact that it is part of Wang&rsquo;s personnel file in the human resources office. The IDS was able to obtain information about the six other alleged victims from an interview with IUPD Detective I think this is the first time this guy is referenced, which means we need his first name here -sm // correct - emilyKoontz.</p>

	<p>Frank LoMonte, director of the Student Press Law Center &mdash; a nonprofit organization that advises campus journalists across the country in First Amendment battles &mdash; scoffed at that explanation. IU, he said, was just making excuses to keep the details of what happened between Wang and the ballet student secret.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;If he had socked her in the mouth, would you regard that as a human resource issue?&rdquo; LoMonte said. &ldquo;Or would you call the police?&rdquo;</p>

	<p>If the attack had not been sexual in nature, LoMonte said, the police would have been involved right away.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s ripping people&rsquo;s clothes off, if he&rsquo;s physically violent, you have to treat that as an emergency,&rdquo; LoMonte said. &ldquo;You have to treat that as the serious accusation it is.&rdquo;</p>

	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Jacobs School of Music, established in 1921, is a crown jewel of IU&rsquo;s campus. The nation&rsquo;s second-best music school, according to a 2010 U.S. College Rankings review, the school produces ballerinas who often land jobs in the highly competitive world of dance.</p>

	<p>In the ballet program, students strive for coveted roles in the annual production of &ldquo;the Nutcracker.&rdquo; This year&rsquo;s production ended Sunday.</p>

	<p>Wang, 54, is a native of China and was a professional dancer with the Shanghai Ballet Company for 11 years before joining the Ballet Chicago in 1993. Wang was honored with a Ruth Page Award for Outstanding Dance Achievement by the Chicago Dance  Community.He became a full-time lecturer at IU in 2007 and was promoted to senior lecturer in 2014. Last year, he coached dancers in &ldquo;the Nutcracker.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Wang declined to be interviewed for this article. The ballet student did not respond to interview requests. Gwyn Richards, dean of the music school, declined to be interviewed but emailed a short statement to the IDS.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;The Jacobs School handled the case as advised by the offices of the campus,&rdquo; Richards wrote. &ldquo;As you can imagine, their assistance was invaluable.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Two IUPD detectives wrote and filed an affidavit after Wang's arrest. According to their affidavit, the ballet student was rehearsing with Wang and other dancers on Nov. 6, 2015. After the rehearsal ended, Wang asked the student to stay and work on her technique.</p>

	<p>After spending a few minutes together in the dance studio, the affidavit says, Wang suggested the student move to the hall to practice stretches. Then he invited her into his office, where he left the door open. He demonstrated stretches in which he laid on his back, then asked the student to mirror him.</p>

	<p>While she was on the floor, stretching on her back, Wang tried to forcibly kiss her, the detectives said. The student pushed him away and stood to leave, but Wang closed the door. He then turned off the light, held the student down and began kissing her on the mouth and breasts.</p>

	<p>The student felt frozen, the affidavit said. &ldquo;Please Guoping, no, this can&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo; she said.</p>

	<p>According to the detectives, she struggled to keep on her leotard as he reached his hands toward her genitals. He picked her up and placed her on the floor of the office. He then pulled the leotard and tights off and tried to sexually assault the student orally.</p>

	<p>Both of them heard a noise from down the hallway. Wang walked toward the door, and the student stood and pulled up her leotard and tights. She was able to walk away.</p>

	<p>As she left, Wang allegedly told her not to tell anyone about what happened.</p>

	<p>The student immediately texted her roommate, who met her outside the Musical Arts Center. For a while, she told no one else. She continued to rehearse for &ldquo;the Nutcracker&rdquo; and performed as scheduled. After winter break, Wang bought the student a birthday gift &mdash; the affidavit does not describe the gift &mdash; and tried to deliver it to the victim through her dance partner. The victim then told her dance partner what had happened.</p>

	<p>Wang continued to work with the ballerina and other students, coaching them for the spring ballet. On March 28, the Monday following the spring ballet&rsquo;s end, the ballerina reported the alleged assault from November to an IU employee.</p>

	<p>Given the position of power Wang held over the ballet student, the 5-month delay on reporting the incident isn&rsquo;t surprising, Middle Way House crisis line employee Audrey Moore said.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;She probably didn&rsquo;t want to compromise this thing she worked so hard on,&rdquo; Moore said. &ldquo;Every person who has experienced sexual or domestic violence has amazing reasons for why they choose to report, or why they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>The University placed Wang on temporary leave and, following its policies outlined as UA-03what&rsquo;s this? -jz, launched its own private investigation involving Title IX Coordinator Emily Springston, the Office for the Vice President of Research and General Counsel. Nothing in the policy prohibits the University from immediately calling the police.</p>

	<p>At some point during the six week investigation, the ballet student requested police involvement. After the assault was reported to police May 4, IUPD detectives dove in. Those who interviewed the student described her credibility and demeanor in the affidavit.UA-03 - pages 13-15</p>

	<p>&ldquo;(Her) account was very similar to the account that was described in the memorandum. She did not deviate in any way. While speaking with Sgt.[first name] because i don't think he's been referenced yet - emily Schmuhl and me, her statement appeared to be credible and her behaviors and stress indicators appeared to be authentic as if she was telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Despite IUPD&rsquo;s belief in early May that the student told the truth, officers waited until months later, on July 13, to sign and date the probable cause affidavit for Wang&rsquo;s arrest. It took that much time, Stephenson said, to reach and interview all seven people.</p>

	<hr>

	<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>U&rsquo;s General Counsel denied the IDS&rsquo;s request to see the 13-page report on the grounds that the report was part of Wang&rsquo;s faculty personnel file, contained information protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and belonged to the IUPD investigatory record.</p>

	<p>After reviewing the original records requests and IU&rsquo;s denial of the requests, LoMonte laid out several reasons why the 13-page report should be accessible.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;This is a complete misstatement of Indiana law,&rdquo; LoMonte said after reviewing the records request denial. &ldquo;If they used the document to make a decision on personnel status, it is not exemption ... the law says they have discretion to withhold or not withhold.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>Because the investigation became a part of IUPD&rsquo;s investigatory record should have no bearing on a University decision to release the report, he added.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;The fact that the report is being used by police is a completely bogus excuse,&rdquo; LoMonte said. &ldquo;This exemption applies to information police gather themselves ... The fact that police stick it into the file does not make it investigatory. That&rsquo;s just wrong.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>LoMonte was also concerned about music school&rsquo;s efforts to keep it quiet.</p>

	<p>Jacobs School of Music&rsquo;s Dean Richards sent a memo to music students on May 9 informing them of the allegations and &ldquo;permanent termination&rdquo; of Wang.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Student safety is of paramount importance to the university, and to the Jacobs School,&rdquo; Richards wrote in his email, a copy of which was provided anonymously to the IDS.</p>

	<p>Richards informed students the &ldquo;situation may draw media attention&rdquo; and told them that all official responses were being &ldquo;coordinated by IU Communications.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Should you receive an inquiry from the media,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;do not feel compelled to respond and, instead forward it to my office.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>The dean&rsquo;s words, while not an explicit request for secrecy, served as a warning to students who may wish to speak with the media, LoMonte said.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Most people read that and assume there&rsquo;s a punishment,&rdquo; he said.</p>

	<p>The alleged victim and those close to her denied requests to be interviewed. IU spokesperson Margie Smith-Simmons told the IDS students were not required to sign confidentiality agreements.</p>

	<hr>

	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he procedural policies that protected the investigation and its findings from public view are not unique to IU. Universities across the country are interpreting the congressional Violence Against Women Act as justification for investigating sex crimes through the Title IX office, as opposed to involving law enforcement, LoMonte said.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;When you run an investigation through the Title IX office, you buy yourself additional secrecy,&rdquo; LoMonte said. &ldquo;People are purposefully using Title IX rather than the police.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>IU&rsquo;s decision to delay police involvement in Wang&rsquo;s investigation is troubling, defense attorney Katharine Liell said, and indicative of a larger issue. Universities should not &ldquo;be in the business&rdquo; of producing parallel investigations for which the criminal justice system already has.</p>

	<p>&ldquo;Why are we taking hundreds of years of jurisprudence that has been refined by the courts in congress and throwing it out the window, and putting together this internal process through a university setting that doesn&rsquo;t have any of the protections for the accused?&rdquo; Liell said. &ldquo;Nor do they really protect a victim if indeed it&rsquo;s really a victim.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>At IU, because of the Title IX procedures, formalities cause delays and evidence loses its credibility, Liell said. Investigations drag on &mdash; sometimes as long as six weeks.</p>

	<p>On July 14, Wang was arrested on charges of sexual battery and criminal confinement, and the details of the &ldquo;the Nutcracker&rdquo; attack finally became public.</p>

	<hr>

	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he 13-page report, the IDS posits, could answer the following questions:</p>

	<p>To whom within the ballet department did the alleged victim report her assault?</p>

	<p>Of the staff who reportedly experienced their own acts of sexual misconduct, who are they, and why did they not report what happened to themselves to the administration?</p>

	<p>Of the offices involved, who within the IU system made the decision to internally investigate the report, and which office could have made the decision to involve law enforcement?</p>

	<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the time-honored way of protecting the sexual assault problem,&rdquo; LoMonte said, &ldquo;by running it through the Title IX office.&rdquo;</p>

	<p>The IDS is interested in talking with students who have any other knowledge of this case or of Wang.</p>

	<p>If anyone is willing to share their knowledge or experience, email us at investigations@idsnews.comitalics -jz, or mail documents to our investigations desk in Franklin Hall, Room 130.</p>
